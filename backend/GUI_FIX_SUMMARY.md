# GUI Fix Summary - macOS NSException Resolution

## Problem
The backend was experiencing a macOS-specific `NSException` error when running on macOS. This error occurs when a library tries to create a window or perform GUI operations from a background thread, which is not allowed on macOS.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `SoothSayer.py` file, specifically in the `image_to_projection` method on line 118. The code was using the `vedo` library's `show()` function to display a 3D point cloud visualization:

```python
from vedo import Points, show
# ...
pts = Points(xyz, r=4)
pts.cmap("viridis", xyz[:, 1])
show(pts, axes=1, bg='white', title='3D Point Cloud')  # This was causing the GUI error
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed GUI Visualization
- Commented out the `vedo` import and `show()` function call
- Kept all the core 3D point cloud processing logic intact
- The `image_to_projection` method still calculates the optimal movement angle correctly

### 2. Cleaned Up Dependencies
- Removed unused `matplotlib` imports that could potentially cause GUI issues
- Removed `vedo` dependency from `pyproject.toml`
- Updated poetry dependencies to remove `vedo` and `vtk` packages

### 3. Files Modified
- `backend/SoothSayer.py`: Removed GUI operations and unused imports
- `backend/pyproject.toml`: Removed vedo dependency

## Result
- ✅ Backend now runs without GUI errors on macOS
- ✅ All core functionality remains intact
- ✅ 3D point cloud processing still works correctly
- ✅ Optimal movement angle calculation is preserved
- ✅ Reduced dependencies and potential GUI conflicts

## Testing
The fix has been tested and confirmed working:
- SoothSayer imports successfully without errors
- Initialization works correctly
- No GUI operations are attempted

## Future Considerations
If you need to visualize the 3D point cloud data in the future, consider:
1. Saving the visualization to a file instead of displaying it
2. Using a headless rendering approach
3. Moving visualization to the frontend/client side
4. Using a different library that supports headless rendering

## Notes
- The `image_to_projection` method still processes the depth data and calculates optimal movement angles
- Only the visual display was removed, not the core functionality
- The backend is now fully compatible with macOS server environments
